### PlusMinus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

On this problem i prioritized code readability and test quality.

### Mini-Max Sum

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Example

arr = [1,3,5,7,9]
The minimum sum is 16 and the maximum sum is 24. The function prints: 16 24
